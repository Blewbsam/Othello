# Othello


## Use:
Othellow is an interactive  two player strategy board game. This project will be an implementation of this game in Java. The project should run on command and therefore be acessible to everyone. This project is of interest to me as Othello is one of my favorite childhood games that involves both calculations and strategical thinking.
