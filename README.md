# Othello

## Motivation
    Othello, sometimes referred to as Reversi, is a two player board game where the goal of each player is two maximize their number of pieces on the board an minimize their opponents. However, unlike many other classical games like chess and go, the structure of the game makes constant shifts in determining who the winner is going to be as a single move could turn upto 56 disks. On an 8x8 board, that is enough to turn the game around. Given the computational complexity of the game and the uncertainty in what constitutes a good position it is usefull to adapt the minimax algorithm to consider depth and a heuristic evaluation of the state given what we know leads to beter circumstances. More detail on these is provided below.
    This program was created as the final project for CPSC 210 in the summer of 2024. The course is about software design and thus encourages extensive testing which has been done by Junit for the model.
